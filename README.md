Following packages are used for Protein Analysis:
The physiochemical properties of amino acid sequence were calculated by different built-in modules of python. For example, molecular weight was calculated by ‘molecular_weight’ imported from ‘Bio.SeqUtils’. Isoelectric point was calculated by ‘Isoelectric Point’ imported from ‘Bio.SeqUtils’. Amino acid composition was calculated by ‘Protein Analysis’ imported from ‘Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam’. Total numbers of positive and negative amino acids were calculated by ‘Protein Analysis’ imported from ‘Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam’. Extinction coefficient was calculated by ‘Protein Analysis’ imported from ‘Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam’. Instability index was calculated by ‘Protein Analysis’ imported from ‘Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam’. Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was calculated by ‘Protein Analysis’ imported from ‘Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam’. Aromaticity was calculated by ‘Protein Analysis’ imported from ‘Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam’. Secondary structure fractions (helix, turn and sheet) were calculated by‘ProteinAnalysis’ imported from ‘Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam’. Net charge was calculated by ‘electrochem’ imported from ‘pyteomics’.
